    This research paper explores the concept of \ac{AMT}. A literature review is
    conducted to provide a concise overview of the subject, including state of
    the art methods and how they can be used to better improve user satisfaction
    of current systems.

    In particular, this paper explores the method known as \ac{NMF} as applied
    to time-frequency representations of audio signals. The primary concept that
    will be reviewed to aid with understanding this technique is the \ac{STFT}.

    A secondary avenue of exploration is machine learning algorithms and their
    application to \ac{AMT} systems. A preliminary review is provided to readily
    prepare the reader for the related discussions and insights uncovered in
    this investigation.

    The design and application of a monophonic \ac{NMF} and polyphonic \ac{NN}
    system are presented followed by a discussion of the results. Thereafter, a
    discussion is presented on how higher level musical knowledge incorporated
    into future models to improve their accuracy.
