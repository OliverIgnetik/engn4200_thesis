    This research thesis explores the concept of Automatic Music Transcription (AMT). A
    literature review is conducted to provide a concise overview of the subject,
    including state of the art methods and how they can be used to better improve
    user satisfaction of current systems.

    In particular this paper explores the
    method known as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization as applied to time-frequency
    representations of audio signals. The primary concept that will be reviewed to
    aid with understanding this technique is the Short Time Fourier Transform.

    A secondary avenue of exploration are machine learning algorithms and their application
    to AMT systems. A preliminary review is provided to readily prepare the reader
    for the related discussions and insights uncovered in this investigation.

    Finally the two methods are compared on a simple excerpt of a jazz trio to evaluate each method and
    highlight advantages and limitations of both methods. Thereafter, a discussion is presented on how higher level musical knowledge such
    as diatonic harmonies, time signatures and modulations can be incorporated into these models to improve their accuracy.
