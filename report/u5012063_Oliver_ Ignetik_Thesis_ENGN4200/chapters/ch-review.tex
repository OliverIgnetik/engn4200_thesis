\section{Signal Processing Techniques}
\subsection{Sampling Theorem}

The sampling theorem is a consequence of digitizing analogue signals. Sampling an analogue signal stores quantized values of the amplitude of a continuous signal at regular intervals determined by the sampling rate. 

The sampling theorem says that to avoid higher frequency components aliasing as lower frequencies components the following must be satisfied. Considering a sampling frequency $F_{s}$ and Nyquist frequency $F_{N}$. 

\begin{equation}
    F_{s} > 2\cdot F_{N}     
\end{equation}

Where B is the highest frequency expected in the signal. Frequently a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz is used in audio recording because the range of human hearing is from 20-20kHz.  


\subsection{Fourier Transform}
\subsection{Short-Time Fourier Transform}

As in other audio-related applications, the most popular tool for describing the time-varying energy across different frequency bands is the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT), which, when visualized as its magnitude, is known as the spectrogram. 

Formally, let $x$ be a discrete-time signal obtained by uniform sampling a waveform at a sampling rate $F_{s}$ Hz. Using a N-point tapered window $w$ (eg. Hamming $w[n] = 0.5-0.46\cdot cos(\frac{2\pi n}{N})$ for $n\in\left[0,N-1\right]$) and an overlap of half a window length we obtain the STFT. 

\begin{equation}
  X [m,k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}w[n]\cdot x[n + m\cdot\frac{N}{2}]\cdot exp\{-j\frac{2\pi k n }{N}\} 
\end{equation}

With $m\in\left[0,T-1\right]$ and $k\in\left[0,K-1\right]$. Here, $T$ determines the number of frames , $K = \frac{N}{2}$ is the index of the last unique frequency value as dictated by the Sampling Theorem. Thus $X[m,k]$ corresponds : 

\begin{align}
    f_{coeff}(k) &= \frac{k}{N} \cdot F_{s} \;\; Hz\\
    t_{frame}(m) &= t \cdot \frac{N}{2F_{s}} \;\; s
\end{align}

$X[m,k]$ is complex-valued, with the phase depending on the alignment of each short-time analysis window. Often it is only the amplitude $\mid X[m,k] \mid$  that is used.

\subsubsection{Log-Frequency Spectrogram}

Note that the Fourier coefficients of $X[m,k]$ are linearly spaced on the frequency axis. Using suitable binning strategies, various approaches switch over to a logarithmically spaced frequency axis, by using mel-frequency bands or pitch bands as seen in \autoref{review:fig:log-STFT-example}. Keeping the linear frequency axis puts greater emphasis on the high-frequency regions of the signal, thus accentuating the aforementioned noise bursts visible as high-frequency content. One simple yet important step often applied in the processing of music signals, is referred to as logarithmic compression. Such a compression not only accounts for the logarithmic nature that describes how humans perceive sound but also balances out the dynamic range of the signal.
